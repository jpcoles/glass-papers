\begin{abstract}
We study the effectiveness of a variety of strong lensing scenarios to inform
the reconstruction of four simulated triaxial halos with stellar and dark
matter components. We conclude that 
1) lenses with multiple sources and high redshift contrast perform very well
2) lenses where the images are already probing the stellar dominated region 
   of a galaxy can be constrained by an estimate of the stellar mass and
   suggest the fraction of dark matter
3) if velocity dispersion measurements are to be used then a sufficiently large aperture 
   is necessary
4) lensing can be used to infer the velocity anisotropy.
We also introduce GLASS, an extensible framework for lens modeling and analysis.

%We attempt to reconstruct the mass profile and distribution of a dark and
%stellar matter triaxial halo using a variety of strong lens configurations,
%stellar mass estimates, and stellar velocity dispersions. The lens
%configurations test quads with small to large image separations (radial
%sampling), extended source information ranging from point images to Einstein
%rings (angular sampling), and multiple sources located at the same and
%differing redshifts (redshift contrast). 

%We conclude that redshift contrast can significantly constrain the mass
%profiles.  Stellar mass estimates can also lead to better reconstructions by
%placing lower bounds on the mass distribution in the inner regions of galaxies.
%Velocity dispersions alone are unlikely to usefully constrain the profile
%because the profile is highly sensitive to the dispersion measurement.  
%Combined with other techniques, however, velocity dispersions can help to
%constrain the range of possible reconstructed solutions. We also introduce
%GLASS, an extensible framework for lens modeling and analysis.

\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Lensing}

The lensing equation
%
\begin{equation}
\vec\beta = \vec\theta - \frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\vec\alpha(\vec\theta)
\label{lensing equation}
\end{equation}
%
maps an observed image position $\vec\theta$ to a source position $\vec\beta$
via the correction term 
%
\begin{equation}
\vec\alpha(\vec\theta) = \frac{4G}{c^2} \int \Sigma(\vec\theta')\frac{(\vec\theta - \vec\theta')}{\ |\vec\theta - \vec\theta'|^2}d^2\vec\theta'
\end{equation}
%
which accounts for the gravitational lensing effect of an intervening mass. For
our purposes we make use of the thin mass sheet approximation and assume that
the lensing mass is infinitely thin compared with the distance between the
source and the lens $D_{LS}$ and the lens and the observer $D_{L}$. These
distances are angular diameter distances where $D_* = (c/H_0)d_*$ and $d_*$ is
a dimensionless number that depends on cosmology.  The lens can then be thought
of as a projected surface density $\Sigma$ which diverts the path of a photon
instantaneously through the bending angle $\vec\alpha$.

Since we will later want to model the mass distribution with a computer it will
be convenient to choose units that make the relevant quantities of order unity.
We therefore measure lengths in light years, time in years, positions in
arcseconds, and choose $c=1$ and $4\pi G = N^2$, where $N^2 \equiv 206,265$
arcsec/rad. The mass unit is then $11.988\ \Msun$. It will also be useful to 
define a proxy to the Hubble constant $\nu \equiv N^2 H_0$.

The arrival (or travel) time $t$ of a photon depends not only on the geometric
path it takes, but also on the general relativistic gravitational time dilation
due to the lens at a redshift of $z_L$.  In its complete form, with all units
and cosmology included we can write the arrival time as
%
\begin{equation}
N^2ct(\vec\theta) = (1+z_L)\frac{D_{L}D_{S}}{D_{LS}}\frac12 |\vec\theta - \vec\beta|^2 - (1+z_L)\frac{4GD_{L}^2}{c^2}\int \Sigma(\vec\theta') \ln |\vec\theta-\vec\theta'| d^2\vec\theta'
\label{full arrival time}
\end{equation}
%
The non-standard factor of $D_L^2$ in the second term comes from the fact that $\Sigma$
has units of \Msun/lyr$^2$. We can clean this up by writing down a dimensionless time
delay 
%
\begin{equation}
\tau = \left[(1+z_L)D_{L}\right]^{-1}ctN^2 = \left[ (1+z_L) \frac{c}{H_0}d_L\right]^{-1}ctN^2 = \left[ (1+z_L) d_L\right]^{-1}\nu t
\label{tau}
\end{equation}
%
in terms of our previous definitions. If we
further define a dimensionless density
%
\begin{equation}
\kappa_\infty = \frac{4\pi G}{c^2}\frac{c}{H_0}d_L\Sigma
              = \frac{d_L}{\nu}\Sigma
\end{equation}
%
and a lensing potential
%
\begin{equation}
\psi(\vec\theta) = \frac1\pi \int \kappa_\infty(\vec\theta') \ln|\vec\theta - \vec\theta'| d^2\vec\theta'\
\end{equation}
%
we can express \eqnref{full arrival time} very compactly as
%
\begin{equation}
\tau(\vec\theta) = \frac12 \xi |\vec\theta-\vec\beta|^2 - \psi(\vec\theta)
\label{arrival time}
\end{equation}
%
where $\xi \equiv D_{S}/D_{LS}$. We explicitly write $\kappa_\infty$ to remind ourselves
that there is no source distance factor involved. This will be useful later when we consider
multiple sources.

If we think of $\tau$ as a surface then images will be observed where ever
$\nabla \tau = 0$. In other words, images obey Fermat's principle and appear at
extremums of the surface. From this we arrive back at \eqnref{lensing
equation}.

The only observables from \eqnref{arrival time} are the image positions, and
perhaps the stellar contribution to $\kappa_\infty$.  If the source object is
variable, however, then the observed light curves of each image will be
identical, but possibly shifted in time due to the different arrival times.
The time difference between identical portions of the light curves is called
the time delay $\Delta t$ between images.  Using \eqnref{tau} the time delay
$\Delta t_{21}$ between two images $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, where $\theta_2$
arrives after $\theta_1$, is $\Delta t_{21} = \Delta \tau_{21}(1+z_L)d_L /
\nu$. If $\beta$ and $\kappa_\infty$ were known exactly this would allow one
to precisely infer the Hubble constant. However, the source position is not
observable and the mass distribution is highly degenerate.

\subsection{Degeneracies} %-----------------------------------------------------

The steepness degeneracy arbitrarily rescales the arrival time surface. Image
positions are left alone but the density profile will become shallower or
steeper. This is particularly bad for inferring the Hubble constant, as the
lens profile will tend to become steeper for larger values of $H_0$.

Other degeneracies include ring degeneracies, where one is allowed to build
up a mass distribution as a series of mass rings; the presence of substructure;
and the effects of merging galaxies. 

Shape degeneracy---a twisting in the mass.

\section{Numerical Methods} 

The lens configurations were generated within the new lens modeling framework
GLASS, described in Appendix \ref{GLASS Description}. 

With this generated data, or data taken from real observations, GLASS can produce
an ensemble of possible mass distributions drawn from the space of solutions by
using a MCMC algorithm.  The technique is similar to that used in PixeLens
(cite Saha, Coles) but with an improved sampling algorithm.

As we have done in previous work, we imposed several priors on the reconstruction to
make it more physical, namely,
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item The density must be non-negative everywhere.
\item The density profile must have a slope $\le 0$. This prevents hollow rings.
\item The local gradient everywhere must point within $45^{\circ}$ of the center.
\item Density variations must be smooth.
\item Image parity.
\item The density is radially symmetric.
\end{enumerate}
%
Since lensing in this case is highly degenerate, many possible realizations are
produced. Each run produced an ensemble of 10000 models.  

The quality of a model $M_i$ in an ensemble is judged by computing
\begin{equation}
\chi_i^2 = \frac{\sum_j (M_{ij} - G_j)^2}{\sum_j G_j^2}
\end{equation}
where $M$ and $G$ are the radial profiles of the model and galaxy, respectively.

\section{Test Data}

\subsection{Four galaxies and their properties} %--------------------------------------------------------------

We consider four different triaxial galaxies, shown in \figref{test galaxies},
where we have varied the slope index of the stars and the dark matter. We
explore the cases were the stars follow either a $\gamma_\star=1$ or
$\gamma_\star=1.5$ profile and where the dark matter profile is cusped or
cored. The enclosed mass $M(a_\star)= 0.18\e{11}$ at the stellar scale
radius $a_\star=2$ kpc is fixed for all galaxies in order to resemble B1115. We
therefore place the galaxy at a redshift $z_L = 0.31$ in a cosmology with
$H_0^{-1}=13.7$ Gyr, $\Omega_M=0.28$, and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.72$.

\begin{figure}

\caption{

and total densities with dotted, dashed, and solid lines, respectively. The

\label{test galaxies}
\end{figure}

%\tabref{source data} summarizes
%each source and image system and \tabref{source time delays} lists the time
%delays.

Each galaxy was generated using the tool DEHNEN with the dark matter and stellar
densities roughly described by Dehnen profiles
%
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{M}{4\pi a^3}(3-\alpha){(r/a)^{-\alpha}(1 + r/a)^{\alpha-4}}
\label{Dehnen profile}
\end{equation}
%
The individual parameters are shown in \tabref{Lens profile params}. 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{clllllll}
Galaxy & $\gamma_\star$ & $M_\star$ & $\gamma_\mathrm{DM}$ & $M_\mathrm{DM}$ \\
\hline
AA & 1 & 4 & 0.05 & $11^{2.95}$ \\
AC & 1 & 4 & 1 & $11^2$ \\
BB & 1.5 & $2^{1.5}$ & 0.16 & $11^{2.84}$ \\
BC & 1.5 & $2^{1.5}$ & 1 & $11^2$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Profile parameters for the four test galaxies. The resulting profiles only roughly follow
\eqnref{Dehnen profile} because the galaxies are triaxial. Masses are in units of $0.18\e{11}\Msun$. The scale lengths for
all lenses are $(a_\star,a_\mathrm{DM})=(2,20)$ kpc and by definition
$M_\star(a_\star) = M_\mathrm{DM}(a_\star) = 1$.}
\label{Lens profile params}
\end{table}



\subsection{Test scenarios} %--------------------------------------------------------------

For each galaxy we constructed ten test scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two double imaged systems with a single point source,
\item Two quadruply imaged systems with a single point source,
\item One extended source, 
\item A two-source system with one source varying across five redshifts. 
%will provide a robust estimate of the enclosed mass at
%several radii, suggesting that given a large enough separation, redshift
%constrast will provide the most robust constraint on the mass profile of a
%halo.
\end{enumerate}

%\tabref{Test configurations} summarizes how each of the configurations is composed.

\subsection{With/without time delays and central image} %--------------------------------------------------------------

We also considered the effect of having time delays or a central image. The
central image is usually highly demagnified and obscured by the lensing galaxy,
but in clusters the central image is observable. In this case we can imagine
the galaxies to be clusters since the problem is scale-free. A recontruction of
AASingleQuadR1a\_Tm is shown in \figref{AASingleQuadR1a_Tm}. The suffix denotes
which combination of time delays (T) and central image (M) was used. An
uppercase letter indicates the feature is turned on, and a lowercase letter
that it is turned off.

\item Construct a lens system where the images are probing the stellar region.
\item Add stellar mass as a minimum constraint on the pixels.
\item Requires more pixels in the middle to correctly and efficiently be resolved
\item Stellar mass improves the reconstruction. Need to explain how.

\section{Velocity dispersions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can they predict radial profiles?
\item Can we constrain lensing models from predicted velocity dispersions?
\item Use a constructed spherical halo G2 following a $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma}$ profile with stellar halo same as G1.
\item Vary $z$ of the halo, possibly orientation.
\item Should be able to recover $\gamma$ very well.
\item Use G1. Show problems with recovering $\gamma$.

%\item Why do we choose {\texttt maprad}=20 arcsec when generating test cases?
%We need to enclose most of the mass for the time delays to be stable.  
%\item Why do we choose {\texttt pixrad}=45 when generating the test cases? We
%need sufficient resolution for the image positions to be stable.

\section{GLASS - An Extensible Gravitational Lens Modeling Framework}
\label{GLASS Description}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Framework that incorporates lens modeling, analysis, and plotting.
\item Not limited to just pixels based modeling. Can be used with functional forms like Bessel functions. Not yet implemented.
\item Allows for post processing and criteria matching on a per model basis.
\item Input files are python programs but from within the framework that aspect may be ignored.

\item Lens reconstruction. Based on PixeLens. Express data constraints and
priors as linear equations. Sample the resulting simplex.
\item Standard data constraints: image positions, time delays, hubble constant, parity, annular density, external shear.
\item Priors: range of profile steepness, local gradient, smoothness, shared H0, symmetry for doubles.
\item Local gradient and smoothness are now convergent. Based on physical size rather than number of neighbors.

\item Raytracing. Use a fine grid to sample the 2d function mapping position on
the image plane to distance from the source on the source plane. From those
points that are near the source, use a 2d root finder to locate the exact
positions. Merge nearly identical solutions.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Raytracing}
Raytracing is sensitive to the map area and resolution set by $\Rmap$ and
$\Rpix$.  In the left panel of \figref{raytracing convergence tests} we compare
the change in time delays as we increase $\Rmap$.  The image system is a quad
with the central maximum image. When the projected mass begins to fall off the
time delays stabilize. In the right panel we see the effect of changing the
resolution of the map.  Increasing the resolution allows for more accurate
placement of the images and after about $\Rpix=40$ the image positions change
by less than 0.04 arcsec. The one image that continues to change is near to a
caustic.
