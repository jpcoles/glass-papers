Reviewer's Comments:

This paper presents GLASS, a new strong lensing analysis package loosely based
on PixeLens developed in part by these same authors.  In addition to strongly
lensed galaxy images, GLASS accepts stellar mass and kinematics data as inputs
to constrain the lensing galaxy's mass distribution.  Tests on mock data are
presented to demonstrate the method's accuracy given various inputs.

The paper is generally clear and well written.  Some of the figures are less
clear.  Below are my comments and suggested improvements.

Major comment:

In this paper, GLASS is tested on individual ellipsoidal galaxies.  It is
claimed GLASS can also model galaxy clusters.  However, some of the rigid
priors described in Section 3.3 do not seem to allow for significant
substructure, namely:

(ii) The density profile must have a slope everywhere <= 0
(iii) The local gradient everywhere must point within 45 degrees of the center
(iv) Density variations must be smooth

If resolved in your models, wouldn't any significant subhalo violate these?

	*** response ***
	These has been a fair amount of discussion on this in the literature from 
	PixeLens which uses an identical prior. There are three key points to note:

	i) Given good enough data, these priors can be switched off or changed. 
	We are looking into when/whether this is possible given the many images 
	seen in clusters and will explore this in future work. It can even be switched 
	off simply for some parts of the mass map (i.e. near to the images or near to 
	known galaxies within the cluster) where we might expect data constraints 
	to be stronger. 

	ii) Even with the prior, we are able to detect multiple "plateaus" in the mass
	distribution, even if we are not able to detect multiple peaks. Two examples 
	are the merger system B1608 (e.g. Read et al. 2007) where using this prior, 
	we clearly resolve the fact that there are two galaxies merging in the mass 
	map; and Saha et al. 2007 where, again with this prior switched on, they
	successfully detected "meso-structure" in two strong lensing clusters. We 
	have now added more discussion to the text to highlight these important
	points.

	iii) Note that GLASS also allows point mass and/or other potentials to be 
	added at locations where there are known substructures (e.g. galaxies 
	within a lensing cluster). This is now used as standard for modelling 
	galaxy clusters; we will present such models in forthcoming papers. 

	We have added a new subsection 3.3.1 explicitly discussing our priors. We
	highlight the above important points; clarify which priors are actually
	used in this paper; and separate 'physical' priors that are unarguable
	from 'regularisation' priors that are more subjective and that ideally should
	be relaxed or removed as the data become sufficiently constraining. 

(iv) is a bit vague; please clarify in the text.  I guess you are referring to
Prior 4 from Coles et al. 2008: "The density of a pixel must be no more than
twice the average density of its neighbors."  If so, please state that here.

	*** response ***
	This is correct, however since we never in fact use this prior we have now
	removed it from the discussion all together. 

And just to clarify, does (ii) really apply to every pixel, or is it possible you meant:
"(ii) The azimuthally averaged density profile..."
which is less restrictive but would still disallow larger subhalos.

	*** response ***
	This should have read "azimuthally averaged", yes. This is now fixed. We 
	also explain that this will disallow very large subhalos (or a large ensemble
	of smaller subhalos at the same projected distance from the lens galaxy). 

Rather than enforcing these priors rigidly ("profile *must* have..."), why not
*prefer* solutions which are smooth, etc. (as in regularization methods) while
still allowing for substructure when required by the data?  Is this a
limitation of the method, that absolutes are required?  If so, please state
that.  Or might the user relax these priors easily using your modular Python
framework?

	*** response ***
	Hopefully this is now clear in the text. Only linear constraints can be 
	applied when building the model ensemble. We now explicitly spell this 
	out at the start of section 3.3. This means that we cannot prefer smooth 
	solutions, but must in some sense demand them. We can, however, 
	apply such non-linear constraints in an accept/reject post processing step. 
	This is where Glass' ability to rapidly generate 10,000 models for a lens 
	becomes useful. We now highlight this important point in the introduction. 

Have you already tried modeling lenses with significant substructure and found
GLASS works well?  If so, please include some discussion of these results in
the manuscript to alleviate my concerns.  Otherwise, it may be worth
emphasizing this limitation in the text: perhaps that GLASS is intended for
roughly symmetric lenses with minimal substructure?

	*** response ***
	Hopefully this is now also much clearer given the new discussion on this 
	in 3.3.1. We are currently in the process of modelling lenses with significant 
	substructure but note that PixeLens has already successfully been applied to 
	merger systems and strong lensing clusters with significant substructure while 
	using similar priors to those outlined here. We now explicitly comment on this 
	in 3.3.1. We defer an analysis of Glass to mock cluster data with substructure
	to a forthcoming publication in preparation. 

Medium comment:

The introduction is interesting but a bit long and, I believe, fails to make a
key point to motivate reading further:  Why do we need another strong lensing
analysis method?  It would be useful to briefly mention other methods
(especially PixeLens) and how GLASS improves on them and/or complements them.
For example, in the last paragraph, which of these aspects are being done for
the first time with GLASS?

	*** response ***
	We have now added a new paragraph to the introduction that explicitly 
	compares Glass with PixeLens and enumerates the improvements/differences
	in Glass as compared to PixeLens. We hope that this is now much clearer. 

Minor comments:

	We thank the referee for spotting this. This is now fixed. 

"Four of these are important for the present work:"
->

	*** response ***
	We thank the referee for spotting this. This is now fixed. 

"Such ensembles are possible in parametric models (Bernstein & Fischer 1999)
but are more common in free-form models..." Ensembles have become more common
in parametric modeling since 1999.  For example, Jullo et al. 2010 used a
Bayesian MCMC implementation of Lenstool to model Abell 1689 and constrain
cosmology.  Also note all of the Frontier Fields lens modelers contributed
ensembles of models based on both "parametric" and "non-parametric" methods.

	*** response ***
	We thank the referee for pointing this out. We have now added these 
	references and pointed out that parametric models are increasingly using
	model ensembles also.   

Section 2

"The lens can be thought of as a projected surface density"
->
"Using the thin lens approximation, the lens..."

	*** response ***
	We have now made this change. Thank you. 

I suggest not using the \times symbol in equations 8 and 10, reserving it instead for vector cross products.

	*** response ***
	We have now made this change. Thank you.

Regarding the mass-sheet degeneracy, please clarify: "rescaling the surface
density at the images kappa(theta)".  I read this as multiplying kappa by some
constant only at the image positions.  This should be corrected to: kappa
multiplied everywhere by some constant and then another constant added.

	*** response ***
	We have now clarified this. Thank you. 

Section 3.1

There are two entries labeled (vi).

	*** response ***
	This is now fixed. Thank you. 

Section 3.3

How fast is GLASS?  You mention ensembles of ~ 1000 models.  How long does this take to run?

	*** response ***
	We have now added this information at the end of section 3.4. For 1000 
	models, the start up costs dominate so it is almost as fast to run 10,000. 
	However, we find for the tests in this paper that 10,000 models give a nearly
	identical statistical distribution to 1000. The larger ensembles will, however,
	be very important when we start throwing out models using non-linear 
	constraints. We will consider this further in future work.

Section 4.2:  Figure 2

"The â€˜extendedâ€™ configurations use multiple point sources at the same redshift to simulate an extended source that will produces an arc-like image.  Figure 2 shows..."

That description does not match what I see in Figure 2.  That is, I do not see multiple points lensed to form arc-like images.

"R1, R2, R3" suggest radii, not redshifts.  I suggest renaming them and also tying them to colors in the plot:
Z1 = 0.51 (blue)
Z2 = 0.72 (green)
Z3 = 1.72 (red)
(Different symbols could be used for multiple sources at the same redshift.)

Then you might refer to the six test cases as:
DoubleZ3
ExtendedDoubleZ3
ExtendedQuadZ3
QuadZ3
QuadZ2Z3
QuadZ1Z3

In the top right panel, it's not clear to me how three sources can be lensed to
form images at the locations shown.  Can you please double check this?  And in
what direction is the ellipsoidal lens oriented in this plot?

	*** response ***
	We have now changed the labels as requested. We also plot the source 
	positions for the extended sources and mark their maximum physical
	separation in the Figure caption $$$ JONATHAN TO DO THIS. MORE HERE
	ON PHYSICAL MEANING OF SEPARATION. COMMENT ON ARC VISIBILITY. 
	I LIKE THE REFEREE IDEA OF USING COLOURS AND SYMBOLS. CAN WE 
	DO THAT ALSO PLEASE?  

        In the top right panel, the circles and the triangles have a
        different time-ordering from the squares.  The ordering for
        the circles and triangles are ordered bottom-top-right-left,
        whereas the squares are bottom-top-left-right.  This is the
        origin of the somewhat curious image configuration.

        The lens is roughly left-right elliptical.

Figure 2 caption:
"The central image belongs to only to the R1 source to avoid overconstraining the models."
Please clarify:
"Central image constraints are only provided for the R1 source..."
And is this simply meant to reflect realistic data sets (that central images are difficult to identify)?  Or are you saying GLASS performs oddly (over-constraining models) when multiple central images are given as input?

	*** response ***
	We now explain this in more detail in section 4.2. We use only one central 
	image since otherwise all the central images would fall within the central pixel 
	and no solution exists that satisfies all locations simultaneously for one pixel
	value. This could be solved by having an even finer grid in the centre, but
	that is beyond the scope of this paper. 

Results:

Section 4.2
"GLASS correctly returns a small or zero shear in all cases."
Could you briefly discuss possible model degeneracies between shear and ellipticity?

	*** response ***
	Our mocks do not have any external shear, but we allow models to have 
	unconstrained external shear in the recovery. Thus, where we obtain good
	shape information, the shear is well constrained. We discuss degeneracies 
	between shear and shape now in the paragraph before section 5 and in 3.1,
	point number (vii). 

Section 5

Strongly lensed images constrain the lensing galaxy's total mass (dark matter +
stellar).  But in several places, you seem to suggest GLASS is modelling the
dark matter component only.  For example, in Figure 3 you label the model
results "DM".  And in Section 5.3, when stellar mass is used as a constraint,
you say "we assume a perfect recovery of the stellar mass".  I would rephrase
this to say the input stellar mass sets a lower limit to the total mass in the
lensing model.

Regarding Figure 3 (which I find confusing), in the middle and right columns, I would plot the following with modified labels and colors such as:
- Input: magenta
- Stars: yellow (where used as a lower limit constraint: second row)
- Result: black with gray error band

I expect the gray shaded region to correspond to the black line (similar colors).  I believe your "result" is always total mass (DM + stars) as constrained by the model.  In your current plots, however, the result line (always banded by gray) is usually magenta (DM only) except in the second row when it's blue (total mass).  I see no need for a separate DM-only result line.

You might label the vertical lines to emphasize them as the range of image radii where results are expected to be best.

I further suggest breaking Figure 3 into two figures.  The top two rows make one point: that the prior on stellar mass improves the model.  The bottom two rows make another point: the GLASS priors favor steeper slopes.  A separate figure for each point would make all of this easier to digest.

	*** response ***
	We have largely edited/changed the Figures along the lines suggested above.
	We hope that these are clearer now.

Section 5.1

I suggest beginning by emphasizing and quantifying how well GLASS recovers what
strong lensing constrains best: mass enclosed within the Einstein radius or so
(where lensed images are found), while noting this is different from the
results plotted in Figures 5 and 6.  Hopefully you can also say your range of
ensemble models always includes the true M(<R).

It would also be useful to show (if not here, then in future work) how well
GLASS recovers the mass profile slope near the image positions (one of the keys
to constraining cosmology with time delays).

"the error bars are smallest in the region of the images"
->
"the accuracies and precisions are best in the range of radii with lensed images"

	*** response ***
	$$$ DID WE DO OR SAY SOMETHING HERE? 
  JPC: We don't say anything explicitly and we have done any tests that look at
  the slope recovery around individual lenses. From the radial profiles the
  slope is best constrained around the images.

Section 5.1

I find your two "main results" plots (Figures 5 and 6) redundant (although you
say later in Section 5.2 that this is making a point about the shape recovery).

Please use more consistent y-axis limits for the plots.  For example, you might
set all lower limits to zero and the upper limits to one of the following for
each plot: 0.5, 0.9, or 3.5.

	*** response ***

For f_R, please briefly state how many bins you used with what spacing (linear? log? equal numbers of pixels?).

	*** response ***
	We have now done this. Thank you. 

I find the T/t, M/m notation confusing.  In place of (TM, Tm, tM, tm), I suggest something like:
TD+central

	*** response ***
	We have now done this. Thank you.

Section 5.2

Please briefly describe in words the meaning of your shape parameter "s".  Is it related to ellipticity?

	*** response ***
	We have now clarified this. It is now defined in equation 21. 


Section 5.4

"with time delays and stellar mass (left), and the same but without stellar mass (right)."
->
"with time delays and stellar mass (middle), and the same but without stellar mass (left)."

	*** response ***
	We have now fixed this. Thank you.

Figure 8 caption:
Note (as you do in the text) that the gray shaded regions correspond to the
full ensemble distributions for beta = 0 and 1, respectively.  I suggest using
different colors for the two bands.  As is, it looks more like a plot of, say,
68% (darker) and 95% (lighter) confidence regions.

	*** response ***
	We have now fixed this, using differently oriented diagonal hatching. 
	We hope that this is now clearer.
