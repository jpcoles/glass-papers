Scientific Editor's Comments:

The referee has some suggestions for improvements that you may wish to address.
We should be able to accept the revised version. In the acknowledgments you
perhaps mean "useful", not "usual".

	*** response ***
        This has been corrected. Thank you.

The arXiv references are still missing the preprint number, e.g., "Amendola L.
et al., 2012, ArXiv e-prints" Do you mean, for example, arXiv:1203.5494?
Please check all the arXiv citations, and if the paper has been published cite
the published version (unless it is significantly different from the preprint
that you read, in which case you should explain why you prefer the preprint
version).

	*** response ***
        I have updated the earlier paper with their proper journal references.
        Two of the three new papers suggested by the referee are still in preprint. (See below.)


Assistant Editor's Comments:

The Master Lens URL still goes straight to a login page. It appears that this
resource is not yet publicly available. However, if you wish to keep the URL I
won't object any further.

	*** response ***
        This is the correct URL, although access to the catalogue does
        require a user to request an account.


Whenever you submit a revised paper to MNRAS, please provide a version which
highlights the changed text in e.g. bold or colour (latexdiff can do this for
you automatically). This makes it much easier - and therefore faster - for the
editor and referee to assess the changes.

	*** response ***
        We are attaching ms-diff.pdf which highlights the changes made.
        Thank you for the suggestion.

Reviewer's Comments:

Dear Jonathan et al.,

Thank you very much for your thorough work addressing my comments and improving
both the text and figures.  Apologies for my delay in replying.

I am happy to accept your paper for publication in MNRAS.

	*** response ***
        Thank you very much. We appreciate the time and effort you have given to this paper.

In the revisions, I caught a few very small things you may wish to address, but
I will not need to review your paper again:

Introduction
ii) Model ensembles:
You may wish to cite one or more of the recent papers which present model
ensembles of the Frontier Fields clusters:
Johnson et al. 2014 (arXiv:1405.0222)
Richard et al. 2014 (arXiv:1405.3303)
Coe et al. 2014 (arXiv:1405.0011)

	*** response ***
        We have added the citations. Thank you.

Section 3.3.1 Priors
Regularisation priors:
(iii) -- you might note the symmetry prior is used sometimes for galaxies, never for galaxy clusters

"Prior (ii) is arguably a physical prior sense negative azimuthally averaged
density slope would be unstable." I think you meant "since" instead of "sense",
although I think the sentence would still be a bit confusing.

	*** response ***
        We have corrected this sentence. There was also the mistake that "negative" should have benn "positive"
        since it is desired that the slope be negative. It now reads:

"Prior (ii) is arguably a physical prior since a positive slope in the
azimuthally averaged density profile would be unstable."
